## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Static HTML**: Single-page application using vanilla HTML5
- **No JavaScript Framework**: Pure HTML without any client-side scripting
- **No CSS Framework**: Basic HTML without styling dependencies
- **Responsive Design**: Includes viewport meta tag for mobile compatibility

### Backend Architecture
- **None**: This is a static site with no server-side components
- **Hosting**: Designed to be served as static files from any web server

## Key Components

### Core Files
- `index.html`: Main entry point containing the complete application

### HTML Structure
- Standard HTML5 doctype declaration
- Proper document structure with head and body sections
- Basic meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings
- Simple "Hello World" content in the body

## Data Flow

### Static Content Delivery

2. Web server serves the static HTML content
3. Browser renders the page directly

## Deployment Strategy

### Static Hosting Options
- **File Server**: Can be served from any basic web server
- **CDN**: Compatible with content delivery networks
- **Static Site Hosts**: Suitable for platforms like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages
- **Local Development**: Can be opened directly in browsers for testing

### Requirements
